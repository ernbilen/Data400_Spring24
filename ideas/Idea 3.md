Intro to the Data

My third idea for a dataset to be used for the mini project is titled Unemployment in America per US State. The content of this dataset is taken directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which means that it is the most credible data for this topic. While all 50 states are displayed in this data, so is New York City, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. To understand US unemployment rates, the first step is to see what's going on in the numbers. Using this offical government data is a good baseline for creating/enhancing social programs and looking at current policies regarding welfare and employment opportunities in the US. Which areas of the US have the highest unemployment rates? If rural areas are more at risk, how can we expand our employment programs to include those states equally? Do larger states generally have higher unemployment within this time frame (1976-2022)? Similarly to my first idea, there are many directions I could take when using this dataset.

Potential Ethical Implications

While this data does come directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we can assume that they have an ethically sound method of collecting this data, unemployment statistics are still semi-private information. This is the common problem with using Data Analytics tools within the field of Sociology because there is a lot of grey area when it comes to privacy and ethics. Another aspect of sociological data is the unreliability of it. We don't know that the data is accurate and representative of the US population. Also, this dataset does not delve into any demographic variables such as race, gender, or class (to name a few). These factors logically could have an impact on unemployment rates in America, and especially in certain states/regions. There is a lot that is left out if I were to just use this dataset in research. I would likely choose to utilize another dataset including these variables to try to develop a more well-rounded view on unemployment in the US, because we can't just blindly trust the numbers of this dataset.

Data Processing

This dataset can be found on Kaggle.com by user justin2028. It is compiled of 29,893 samples and 11 columns, which could easily be cut down by state/area/region as well as population, unemployment rate, or percentage of US labor force. A lot could be done with this data, but like I said, I would likely combine it with other data to get a more comprehensive understanding of true unemployment trends. Choosing additional variables would likely come from doing literature research on what has been discovered in the past, such as the effect of gender on the likelihood of unemployment. Additionally, some cleaning of the data would need to happen depending on the question at hand.
