## I. Research questions
- Predicting Yelp ratings using textual reviews


## II. Motivation & potential implications
- Utilizing the Yelp Challenge Dataset to develop a model predicting ratings from textual reviews holds significant promise and relevance in several domains.

- Firstly, such a model could empower businesses to gain deeper insights into customer sentiments and preferences, enabling them to tailor their offerings and services more effectively. Moreover, in the realm of consumer advocacy, this model could serve as a powerful tool for consumers to make more informed decisions about where to spend their time and money, promoting transparency and accountability within the market. 

- Academically, this project contributes to advancing natural language processing techniques, particularly in sentiment analysis and text-based rating prediction. By exploring this dataset, we have the opportunity to uncover intricate patterns and nuances in language that correlate with customer satisfaction, thereby enriching our understanding of human behavior and preferences in the context of online reviews. Ultimately, the implications of this endeavor extend beyond the confines of Yelp, with potential applications in diverse industries such as hospitality, e-commerce, and beyond.
