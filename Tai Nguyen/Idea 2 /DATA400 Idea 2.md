## I. Research questions
Assessing the effectiveness of spaced repetition algorithms in improving long-term retention of vocabulary in language learning apps: The case study of Duolingo


## II. Motivation & potential implications
Language learning has long been a focal point of my academic journey, especially as an international college student in the United States. Alongside mastering English, I have enthusiastically pursued French and Japanese as both a hobby and to expand potential career opportunities.

In recent years, the emergence of language platforms and apps has revolutionized the accessibility and affordability of language acquisition. These technological solutions offer a myriad of methods, including gamification, speech recognition, and chatbots, to cater to diverse learning needs. However, among these methods, spaced repetition stands out as a central approach widely adopted by modern language learning apps to facilitate vocabulary acquisition and retention.

With access to the dataset, I am interested in delving deeper into the efficacy of the spaced repetition technique integrated by these companies. My research aims to thoroughly examine the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach, shedding light on its impact on language learners' vocabulary retention and overall learning outcomes. Through rigorous analysis and interpretation of available data, I seek to contribute valuable insights to the field of language learning technology.
