## I. Research questions
- How do demographic shifts, such as population growth, migration patterns, and generational preferences, impact the housing market dynamics at a regional level? (Demographic Trends)
- Can data analytics identify correlations between demographic characteristics and housing market trends? (Demographic Trends)
- How do changes in interest rates influence the demand and supply dynamics in the housing market? (Impact of Economic Factors)
- Using geospatial data, what patterns and disparities exist in housing prices and affordability across different urban and rural areas in the United States? (Geospatial Analysis)


## II. Motivation & potential implications
Housing market has always been a compelling topic due to its profound impact on individuals, communities, and the broader economy. Understanding the dynamics of the housing market is crucial for policymakers, real estate professionals, and citizens alike. 

By delving into this field, we gain insights into economic stability, social equity, and sustainable urban development. Ethically, analyzing the housing market allows us to address disparities, ensuring fair access to housing and promoting inclusive growth. From a legal perspective, it informs regulatory frameworks and policies, contributing to a balanced and transparent real estate landscape. On a societal level, housing market analysis has implications for wealth distribution, community well-being, and the realization of the fundamental right to shelter. 

As potential homebuyers, we may navigate complex issues like affordability, urbanization, and environmental sustainability. Robust understanding of the housing market becomes imperative for fostering resilient and just societies. In exploring this multifaceted domain, we not only unravel intricate market patterns but also strive towards creating ethical, legal, and socially responsible solutions to the challenges that define our living spaces.
