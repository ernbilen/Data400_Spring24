# MINI PROJECT: Promoting Legal Literacy Among Students: Implications for Juvenile Crime Rates in School Settings #

### Research Question ###
How does promoting legal literacy among students influence juvenile crime rates in school settings, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship?

## Introduction ##
Legal literacy plays a crucial role in empowering individuals to navigate legal systems, understand their rights and responsibilities, and make informed decisions. In the context of schools, promoting legal literacy among students can have far-reaching implications for their behavior, interactions with authority figures, and involvement in delinquent activities. Understanding the relationship between legal literacy among students and juvenile crime rates in school settings is essential for designing effective interventions to promote safety, well-being, and positive youth development.

## Motivation ##
The motivation for this study stems from the recognition of schools as microcosms of society where legal knowledge and behavior intersect. By investigating the impact of legal literacy initiatives on students' understanding of laws, rights, and consequences, we aim to shed light on their role in preventing juvenile delinquency and promoting a culture of lawfulness in educational environments.

## Data Collection ##
Data collection will primarily rely on available datasets and scraped data sources due to limitations on conducting interviews or surveys. Utilizing publicly available datasets from educational institutions, government agencies, and research organizations will provide valuable information on legal literacy initiatives, disciplinary incidents, and juvenile crime rates in school settings. Additionally, scraping data from online platforms, social media channels, and educational forums may offer insights into students' discussions, perceptions, and experiences related to legal education and juvenile delinquency.

The data collection process will involve identifying relevant datasets and scraping techniques to extract pertinent information on legal literacy programs, disciplinary actions, and crime reports within school environments. Data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning, merging, and formatting, will be employed to ensure data quality and compatibility across different sources. Statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the data, identify patterns, and draw insights into the relationship between legal literacy among students and juvenile crime rates in schools. While qualitative data collection methods are not feasible, leveraging available datasets and scraped data sources will enable us to conduct rigorous empirical analysis and contribute valuable findings to the research inquiry.

## Data Analysis ##
In studying how legal knowledge affects student behavior and school crime rates, we can use different models to understand this relationship. Regression analysis helps us see how legal literacy levels influence behavior while considering other factors. To make these models better at predicting behavior, we can use machine learning techniques. For example, ensemble learning methods like random forests or gradient boosting combine multiple models to capture complex patterns in the data. Neural networks, another technique, are good at finding hidden patterns in large datasets. We can also use methods like feature engineering and regularization to improve model performance. By using these techniques along with traditional models, we can learn more about how legal knowledge affects student behavior and find ways to make schools safer.


# Idea 2: Impacts of the Global Saving Glut on Banking Sector Loan Behaviors: A Multiscale Observation and Analysis #
* A continuation from my personal project in ECON 314.
* The main sources of data are the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), and World Bank Data, obtained for the period from 1991 to 2022. The dataset is in time-series structure, documenting changes in the variables of interest over time. The unit of analysis is nationwide over 32 observations. In the course of analyzing the dataset and engaging in various exercises, certain limitations and drawbacks have emerged that may impact the reliability and breadth of the study's outcomes. Firstly, a significant constraint lies in the relatively brief time span covered by the dataset, starting from 1991 to 2022. This limitation hinders the examination of long-term trends and cyclical patterns, potentially overlooking crucial economic shifts. Ideally, a more extended time series would offer a more comprehensive view of the dynamics related to capital inflows and outflows.
Furthermore, the variable coverage of the dataset is limited to capital-related indicators, excluding other potentially significant elements such as specific economic policies, regulatory changes, or detailed institutional characteristics. A broader set of variables would enrich the analysis by considering a broader range of factors. 
* The dependent variables here are US Current Account Balance (bop), Asset Quality Measure in small US banks (asset_small), Asset Quality Measure in large US banks (asset_large), Delinquency Rate for small US banks (delin_small), and Delinquency Rate for large US banks (delin_large).
* Data is available but needs improvement: more variables, more observations.
* Novelty: not entirely new, but limited literature on the topic. One novelty aspect: different-scale banks.
* Limitations: tackle potential endogeneity and homogeneity.


# Idea 3: How do weather patterns and environmental factors impact air quality, and can machine learning models accurately predict air pollutant levels based on meteorological data and geographical features? #

This research question involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between weather conditions, environmental factors, and air quality, followed by the development of machine learning models for prediction. The project would require a dataset containing historical records of meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed), geographical features (elevation, land use), and air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, ozone, nitrogen dioxide). EDA would help identify correlations and patterns between these variables, guiding the selection and engineering of features for machine learning modeling.
