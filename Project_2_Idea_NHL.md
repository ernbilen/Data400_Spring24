# Project 2  Idea

### Research Question 

What factors contribute the most to an NHL Team making the Stanley Cup Playoffs? Could a profitable sports betting model be made based off of the findings? 

  

  

### Implications and Why it is Interesting 

This idea can help coaches understand what to focus on to make the Stanley Cup Playoffs. It can help to shape what drills coaches run during practice or what type of players they may want to acquire in the offseason. Understanding what factors help teams to make the playoffs can create a more competitive league and make more similar play styles amongst teams. This could also lead to more innovation between teams in the league to help separate them from other teams. At the same time, ethical problems such as fair competition can arise, if certain factors do impact the probability of playoff qualification, teams may attempt to exploit these factors, potentially undermining the integrity of the sport. If the model does appear to show correlations between certain characteristics and making playoffs, this could be used to create a sports betting model that could potentially be profitable. The model needs to be better at betting than the average person instead of Vegas as Vegas moves lines to make sure they are always profitable against the public. If the model becomes profitable, it could feed into peoples gambling addictions and we would have to ensure that the betting system is legal and complies with all betting regulations. If the model becomes profitable and successful, it can have potential economic implications including job creation. Although the potential understanding of playoff qualifications may enhance fans' enjoyment of the game, the focus could shift towards gambling which could take away from the joy of the game for some fans. We could need to ensure that the implications of this research and betting model would be beneficial for all stakeholders involved.  

  

### Data and Model Specifications 

This data will be collected from a data set on KAggle as well as MoneyPuck. There is some cleaning needed for the datasets including deleting certain variables and deciding which ones are most important. The data appears to be organized well and should be easy to use and understand. Once the data is cleaned, I can use logistic regression to predict if the team will make the playoffs and use a probability threshold of .7 or greater to determine if the team will make the playoffs. Once I have the percentage, I can convert that into betting lines and compare them to current playoff lines to see if there are any lines that could be exploited. Neural Networks could be used to find relationships and make predictions as well.
