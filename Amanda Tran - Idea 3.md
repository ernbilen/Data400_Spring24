# Project Proposal: Improving Autonomy in The Sims 4 Through Data Analytics

**Introduction**

The Sims franchise, particularly The Sims 4, has been a popular life simulation game that allows players to control virtual people, known as "Sims," and simulate various aspects of their lives. One of the key features of the game is the autonomy mechanism, which allows Sims to perform actions without player input. However, this mechanism has been criticized by many players for being ineffective and not contributing positively to the gameplay experience.

Interestingly, The Sims 4 has been used in machine learning projects like Sims4Action, which uses life simulation to construct training examples for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This has been particularly useful in training smart/robot-assisted living accommodations. This project aims to improve the autonomy mechanism in The Sims 4 through data analytics, thereby enhancing both the gameplay experience and the utility of the game in machine-learning applications.

**Research Questions**

1. How do factors such as age, aspiration, needs, traits, and moods correlate with (1) the autonomous choice made by a Sim? (2) prioritization of actions of a Sim?
  - Methodology: Correlation analysis will be used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between these factors and the autonomous choices made by Sims.
2. How can the model to determine autonomous choices in the Sims be improved?
  - Methodology: Predictive analytics techniques, such as regression analysis, will be used to develop a model that can predict autonomous choices based on the factors identified.

**Data**

Data will be collected from a 1-game-week-long observation of 4 Sims (research subjects) with 1 shared aspiration and 3 randomized traits. The Sims will include 1 Adult Sim living alone, 1 Elder sim living alone, and 1 family of 1 adult sim and 1 dependent elder sim. Each living arrangement will include a living space, dining space, bathroom, and a bedroom with 1 double bed provided to each Sim. All rooms will be equipped with necessities. Sims will also be given one item from each different sub-category of the "activities" item category. This experiment follows a similar setup by YouTuber [Whiny Brit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1OAzmXnxr8).

To measure the actions, I will use the in-game video capture options or external software like OBS Studio. For example, if a Sim has a "Lazy" trait, I will record the number of times the Sim chooses to watch TV or nap within the observation span. This can be done by manually counting the actions while reviewing the recorded gameplay.

**Significance and Implications**

The findings from this project could help Electronic Arts improve the autonomy mechanism as they work towards Project Rene, the next Sims game in the Sims franchise. Additionally, it could enable the implementation and improve the accuracy of projects similar to Sims4Action, which uses life simulation to train robots and smart home systems catered towards elderly and adult living.

**Conclusion**

By leveraging data analytics, this project aims to uncover insights that can help improve the autonomy mechanism in The Sims 4, thereby enhancing the gameplay experience and the utility of the game in machine-learning applications.
