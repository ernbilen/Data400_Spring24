## Limitations.
- I only have the data on how frequently people listen to different types of music, But I don't have the extent of the pain scale. I can't tell whether the patient feels better or worse.
- music flavor and preference is very subjective. People suffering from depression may like hip-hop and rap music instead of Blues music.
- The dataset is small with about 700 rows
