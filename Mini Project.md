# MINI PROJECT Ideas #

## **Idea 1**. A continuation and development of "Impacts of the Global Saving Glut on Banking Sector Loan Behaviors: A Multiscale Observation and Analysis" ##
* Data is available but needs cleaning and arranging.
* Novelty: not entirely new, but limited literature on the topic. One novelty aspect: different-scale banks.
* Difficulty: very academic, potential biases, homogeneity.

## **Idea 2**. Legal Literacy among civilians, exspecially women, and the impact on the economy ##
* Problems: Needs to be more focused on one country/one area of law/ one legal system, data sources (scrape or available - is it possible to scrape?)
* Relatively novel and interesting. 

## **Idea 3**. Does microloans help lift women and/or women-headed households out of poverty? ##
* Problemns: data
* Novelty: It is already studied, but not so much in this specific branch.
* Interesting: relate to CRA

- Economy course sequence: anything company related, consumers, users.
- 1-page explanation: motivation (why, potential implications), data strategy, rubric -> clearly outlined. Submit before class on Friday. Should be a .md
