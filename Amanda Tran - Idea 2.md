# Project Proposal: Uncovering Student Profiles and Networks Using the ELS:2002 Database

**Introduction**

The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) is a nationally representative, longitudinal study of 10th graders in 2002 and 12th graders in 2004 (National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.). It aims to monitor the transitions of young people as they progress from tenth grade and twelfth grade to schooling beyond high school and the world of work National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.). The study provides longitudinal data about the critical transitions experienced by young people as they complete high school, enroll in college, enter the workforce, and embark on their careers. This project aims to utilize this data to create student personas and establish networks of interactions that influence post-secondary outcomes and academic performance.

**Research Questions**

The ELS:2002 Cumulative Student File, which includes student, parent, and teacher interviews, school-level administrator and staff interviews, school-level composites, HS transcript composites, and postsecondary educational transcript composites, will be used to address the following questions:

1. **Student Personas** : Can we identify distinct student personas based on their academic and personal characteristics?
  - Methodology to consider: Apply unsupervised learning (clustering) techniques to group students with similar characteristics.
2. **Networks of Interactions** : How do a student's post-secondary outcomes/academic performance relate to their secondary institution's facilities/resources, their families, and their social circles?
  - Methodology to consider: Apply regression analysis to establish relationships between these factors.

**Data**

The ELS:2002 Cumulative Student File contains 16,197 observations of 4,012 variables (National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.). These variables cover a wide range of data points, including student interviews, parent interviews, teacher interviews, school-level administrator and staff interviews, school-level composites, HS transcript composites, and postsecondary educational transcript composites (National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.). The data is tractable and can be retrieved through the Online Codebook (National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.).

**Significance and Implications**

The findings will provide a nuanced understanding of student experiences and outcomes transitioning from high school into either post-secondary education or the workforce, as well as environmental factors that motivated their choices. This can inform educational institutions, policymakers, and families about the factors that contribute to student success. Additionally, it can help tailor interventions and resources to specific student personas. The implications of the findings will be discussed in light of existing theories in education, such as Bourdieu's theories of habitus and capital (Bourdieu, 1986; Bourdieu, 1990). These theories provide a framework for understanding how social and cultural reproduction contributes to educational inequality (Bourdieu, 1990), and can add depth to our understanding of the factors influencing student outcomes.

**Conclusion**

By leveraging the rich data provided by the ELS:2002, this project aims to uncover insights that can help shape educational policies and practices to better serve students and improve their post-secondary outcomes.
