# Idea Proposal: Text Analysis of News Headlines and Correlation Analysis with Tech Stock Prices

This idea explores the intriguing connection between news headlines and tech stock prices. Our project will leverage The New York Times API and financial data sources to build a model that analyzes news headlines and correlates it with stock price movements.

## Tractable data:

- **News Headlines:** Leverage The New York Times API to capture relevant keywords in headlines. Focus initially on a specific set of tech-related keywords and a defined timeframe.
  
- **Stock Prices:** Utilize free and available historical stock price data from the yahoo finance library in Python.

## Data Retrieval:

- Write Python script to retrieve the headlines from the web and pre-process the headline and transfer it to a data frame.
  
- Import the stock prices from Yahoo Finance and query it to have another data frame that has the needed stock prices.

## Correct Specification of the Model:

- Start with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient. This will measure the linear relationship between two numerical variables. Useful for analyzing the overall connection between the frequency of tech-related words and stock prices.

- Continue with a linear regression model predicting stock price based on various explanatory variables, including headline features.

## Implications for Stakeholders:

- **Investors:** Provide insights into how the frequency of tech-related words might influence short-term or long-term stock price movements. Offer disclaimers on limitations and risks of using news for investment decisions.

- **Financial Media:** Develop tools that identify emerging trends and shifts in news coverage related to specific companies or sectors.

- **Tech Companies:** Monitor public perception surrounding their brands and products by analyzing news narratives.

## Ethical, Legal, Societal Implications:

- Ensure model outputs are not used for manipulative or discriminatory purposes.

- Emphasize the limitations of the analysis and avoid promoting it as a financial prediction tool.

- Acknowledge the broader societal implications of technology and its impact on news dissemination and financial markets.
