# Data Analysis Plan for Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Customer Reviews

## Project Overview

This project aims to scrape and analyze customer reviews from Amazon to perform sentiment analysis. By determining the polarity scores of reviews, we will classify the sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. This analysis will help uncover relationships between the sentiment of reviews and the ratings given by customers. Further, we will identify frequently mentioned words in reviews that correlate with positive or negative sentiments, providing actionable insights for business improvements across different industries.

## 1. Tractable Data 

**Objective:** My dataset is from Kaggle:[https://www.kaggle.com/code/saurav9786/recommender-system-using-amazon-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews)
The Amazon Review Polarity Dataset originates from a vast collection of reviews detailed in a study by J. McAuley and J. Leskovec, focusing on understanding rating dimensions through review text. Sourced from Amazon, it includes reviews spanning 18 years up to March 2013, reflecting a broad spectrum of consumer opinions and product interactions.
- Contains 34,686,770 Amazon reviews from 6,643,669 users on 2,441,053 products, from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP). This subset contains 1,800,000 training samples and 200,000 testing samples in each polarity sentiment.

## 2. Data Retrieval 

**Objective:** Efficiently and ethically retrieve data without violating platform terms of service.

**Action Steps:**
- Ensure adherence to Amazon's data use policies.
- Eliminate all missing values or N/A values of the dataset from Kaggle. 
- Pre-process the text data (tokenization, normalization) to prepare it for analysis.

## 3.  Exploratory data analysis

- **Logistic Regression:** Establishing a baseline for binary classification of sentiment (positive vs negative).
- **Implementation:**
  - Extract features from text using TF-IDF or count vectorizer.
  - Apply logistic regression to model the relationship between extracted features and the binary sentiment labels.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Random Forests:** Enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness over single decision trees.
- **Implementation:**
  - Utilize the same feature preparation as for decision trees.
  - Train a Random Forest model with multiple trees to improve generalization.
  - Optimize model parameters such as number of trees and max features using grid search with cross-validation.
  - Analyze feature importance to understand which words or attributes most influence sentiment classification.

- **Sentiment Analysis Tools and Models:**
  - Begin with a straightforward tool like **TextBlob** to quickly assess sentiment polarity and subjectivity.
  - For more nuanced understanding and accuracy, integrate advanced NLP models such as **BERT** or **GPT**. These models can better capture contextual nuances in text, improving the accuracy of sentiment classification.

- ** Polarity Score Calculation and Classification:**
  - Use **TextBlob** to derive preliminary polarity and subjectivity scores, where polarity quantifies sentiment on a negative to positive scale, and subjectivity measures the amount of personal opinion and factual information.
  - For complex analyses, employ models like **BERT**, which can be fine-tuned on a labeled dataset to classify sentiments more effectively into categories such as positive, neutral, and negative.

- **Time-Series Analysis of Reviews:**
  - Conduct a time-series analysis to observe trends and changes in sentiment and ratings over time for selected businesses.
  - This can help in identifying patterns such as seasonal fluctuations in sentiment, or changes following specific events or promotions.

- **Visualization of Data:**
  - **Relationship Between Ratings and Polarity:** Create scatter plots or line graphs to visualize how ratings correlate with sentiment polarity scores across different products or time.
  - **Word Frequency Analysis:** Utilize word clouds to visually represent the frequency of words appearing in positive and negative reviews. This helps in quickly identifying which terms are most commonly associated with each sentiment.
  - Additional visualizations might include bar charts comparing the volume of reviews by sentiment over time or heatmaps showing the distribution of ratings.

## 4. Implications for Stakeholders 

**Objective:** Understand and communicate the potential impacts of the analysis on stakeholders including businesses, customers, and platforms.

**Action Steps:**
- Analyze how sentiment scores correlate with business ratings and identify trends or outliers.
- Prepare reports or dashboards that summarize findings in an accessible format for business owners.
- Discuss how businesses can use insights from the data to improve customer satisfaction and service quality.
- Engage with stakeholders through presentations or workshops to demonstrate the value of sentiment analysis in understanding customer feedback.

## 5. Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications

**Objective:** Address ethical concerns and legal compliance related to data privacy and the use of AI technologies.

**Action Steps:**
- Ensure all data handling practices comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Consider the ethical implications of scraping user-generated content and how it is analyzed and presented.
- Maintain transparency about the use of AI models and the potential biases in data or algorithms.
- Develop guidelines for ethical use of the analysis results, avoiding misuse or misinterpretation of the data.
