# Project Plan for Analyzing WeChat Chat History

## Objective
Leverage data analytics to examine the WeChat chat history between you and your girlfriend, aiming to uncover insights into communication patterns, emotional engagement, and relationship dynamics.

## Data Collection and Cleaning
- **Source:** Export chat history from WeChat in CSV format.
- **Preparation:** Ensure data includes timestamps, message content, and sender identifiers, maintaining privacy and data security.
- Clean dataset to ensure privacy and relevance.

  
## Analysis Approach

### 1. Keyword Extraction
- Use NLP techniques to extract frequently used words and phrases.
- Identify dominant themes and subjects in the conversations.

### 2. Word Specificity Statistics
- Analyze the uniqueness of the chat vocabulary.
- Determine the significance of specific words or phrases.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Good for basic NLP tasks, including tokenization and stopword removal, which are essential for keyword extraction.
- **spaCy:** Offers more advanced NLP capabilities and is efficient for extracting linguistic features like lemmas, which are useful for analyzing word specificity.

### 3. Temporal Analysis
- Examine timestamps to identify daily and monthly chat patterns.
- Create visualizations (e.g., heat maps, line charts) for daily chat popularity and monthly enthusiasm.
- **pandas:** For parsing and manipulating timestamps to analyze chat frequencies over different periods.
  
### 4. Frequency Analysis
- Assess message volume over time to infer relationship tendencies.
- Correlate chat frequency with significant milestones or events.
- ** Pandas for aggregating message counts over time and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing trends in chat frequency.
  
### 5. Emotional Impact Assessment
- Explore how specific periods affect emotional tone.
- Use sentiment analysis to gauge emotional fluctuations and engagement.
- **Techniques:** Sentiment analysis to evaluate the emotional tone of messages. - **TextBlob:** Offers out-of-the-box sentiment analysis and is straightforward to use for basic sentiment scores.
  
### 6. Visualization
- Develop visualizations to clearly represent findings.
- Consider creating interactive charts for dynamic trend exploration.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Processing:** Python (pandas for data manipulation).
- **NLP and Sentiment Analysis:** NLTK or spaCy.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn.
