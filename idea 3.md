# Idea Proposal: Correlation Analysis and Future Prediction for Personal Debt and Unemployment Rate

## 1. Introduction:
The interplay between personal debt and unemployment rate carries significant meaning for individuals, policymakers, and the overall economic landscape. This project proposes a comprehensive analysis exploring the correlation between these factors and leveraging that understanding to predict future trends.

## 2. Data Retrieval and Tractability:
- Utilize publicly available unemployment datasets from FRED and the personal debt dataset from New York FED

## 3. Model Specification:
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for time series analysis.
- Evaluate model performance based on criteria like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared values.

## 4. Implications for Stakeholders:
- **Individuals:** Analyze how debt levels and unemployment risk influence financial planning and decision-making. Develop risk mitigation strategies and early warning indicators.
- **Policymakers:** Inform policies on debt management, economic stimulus, and social safety nets based on predicted trends. Evaluate the potential impact of policy interventions.
- **Financial Institutions:** Assess credit risk and develop targeted financial products and services based on future scenarios.

## 5. Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications:
- Address potential biases in data collection and model development.
- Ensure responsible use of predictions, avoiding stigmatization or discriminatory practices.
- Acknowledge the limitations of prediction models and potential unforeseen economic factors.
- Consider the societal consequences of rising debt levels and unemployment, advocating for sustainable economic growth and inclusive financial systems.
