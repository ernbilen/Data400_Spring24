# Project 1 Idea
##### _Thomas Sniezek_

### Research Question
What factors significantly contribute to the generation of the highest revenue in the animated movie industry? 


### Implications and Why it is Interesting
This idea can help producers to understand what factors could cause their movies to make more revenue. More revenue can mean the movies were entertaining and more likely to be watched multiple times. It can help directors understand what to pitch in their initial ideas to movie producers.  Understanding what can create more revenue can create a more competitive animated movie industry which could encourage studios to innovate and invest in elements that resonate with audiences. If the answer provides enough substance and a true way to create more revenue, copyright disputes, intellectual property disputes or potential changes in copyright laws may occur to address this new method. Understanding contributing factors to revenue can provide insights into the economic impact of the animated movie industry, including job creation, revenue distribution, and economic contributions to local communities.  We need to ensure that the research does not contribute to any underrepresentation or feed into any stereotypes regarding animated movies, production companies or actors.  
### Data and Model Specifications
The data will be collected and downloaded from data sets on Kaggle. Multiple data sets may need to be merged to answer the question in depth. The sets found on Kaggle have need for very little cleaning and contain tens of thousands of data points. The data will be easy to use and understand.  Once the data is collected and cleaned, multiple linear regression can be used to analyze the linear relationship between the independent variable, factors such as genre, audience, runtime and budget, and the dependent variable, revenue. Tree based methods could be used to find any non-linear relationships.  These relationships will help to determine if the factor is something a director should pay more attention to when creating the movie or pitching the movie to the production company.
