# **Exploring Career Trajectories Beyond Earnings: A Comparative Analysis of STEM and Non-STEM Graduates**

**Introduction**
Post-secondary education in the U.S. serves as a critical pathway to upward social mobility. Within the past decade, there has been a surge in demand for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills across various industries. Technical roles within STEM fields offer promising employment prospects and higher earning potential (Haskin et al.). However, existing research tends to narrowly focus on comparing STEM and non-STEM career prospects based solely on earnings. This project aims to broaden this perspective by considering additional factors that shape graduates' career trajectories.

**Research Questions**
**The Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (P****SEO****)**  **dataset** from the **U.S. Census Bureau** will be leveraged to address the following questions:

1. **Earnings Disparities** : How do the earnings of graduates with STEM majors compare to those with non-STEM majors at 1, 5, and 10 years after graduation?
-  **Methodology**  **to consider** :
    - Conduct descriptive statistics to compare median earnings between STEM and non-STEM graduates.
    - Perform regression analysis to control for confounding variables (e.g., education level, experience) and assess the impact of major on earnings.
2. **Non-STEM to STEM Transitions** : Which non-STEM majors successfully transition into roles typically associated with STEM fields (e.g., data science, analytics, project management)?
- **Methodology to consider:**
    - Identify non-STEM majors that exhibit high rates of transition into STEM-related roles via logistic regression of transition likelihood.
3.  **Career Trajectories** : What are the long-term career paths of STEM graduates compared to their peers from non-STEM disciplines?
- **Methodology to consider:**
    - Use survival analysis to examine career longevity and progression.
    - Consider factors such as job stability and industry shifts over time.
    
**Significance and Implications** 
The findings will provide more nuanced insights into the existing gaps between STEM and non-STEM career prospects. By emphasizing the unique skillsets obtained through various degrees, graduates can strategically navigate the workforce. Additionally, educational institutions should consider this information to address resource disparities between STEM and non-STEM education. Just as STEM education is marketed as practical and versatile, the same perspective should extend to non-STEM fields (Byrne and Cave).

**Data** 
The [**Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO)** ](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/pseo_experimental.html)data is an experimental tabulation developed by the **Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)** program at the  **U.S. Census Bureau**. Available for open-source usage, it provides earnings and employment outcomes for college and university graduates, categorized by degree level, degree major, and post-secondary institutions. After preprocessing the data, the primary focus will be on bachelor's degree holders in two states: Texas and Virginia. Exploration of patterns related to social factors such as race and gender will also be conducted.
