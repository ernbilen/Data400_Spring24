## Idea Proposal: Correlation Analysis between Aerospace & Defense and Semiconductor Stocks

## 1. Introduction:
This proposal outlines a study investigating the correlation between stock prices of aerospace & defense (A&D) companies and semiconductor chip manufacturers. The project aims to answer:
- Do A&D stock prices move in tandem with chip manufacturers' stock prices?
- What factors drive this potential correlation?
- What are the implications for investors, companies, and policymakers?

## 2. Tractable data 
- Data sources: Utilize freely available historical stock price data from the Yahoo Finance library in Python.
- Scope: Focus on major A&D companies (e.g., Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon) and leading semiconductor manufacturers (e.g., TSMC, Intel, NVIDIA).
- Timeframe: Choose a relevant timeframe based on industry events, chip shortages, or investment trends (e.g., past 5, 10 years).

## 3. Data retrieval 
- Import the stock prices from Yahoo Finance and query it to have another data frame that has the needed stock prices.

## 4. Correct specification of the model 
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize relationships and identify potential outliers.
- Choose appropriate statistical methods and causality tests to measure the correlation and direction of influence (if any).
- Consider robustness checks by employing alternative methods or controlling for external factors like overall market performance.

## 5. Implications for stakeholders 
- Investors: Analyze the risk-return profile of combined portfolios containing A&D and chip stocks.
- Companies: Evaluate potential impact of chip price fluctuations on A&D production costs and profitability.
- Policymakers: Assess the economic interdependence between these industries and potential policy interventions.

## 6. Ethical, legal, societal implications 
- Ensure responsible data handling and transparent methodology.
- Emphasize the limitations of the analysis and avoid promoting it as a financial prediction tool.
- Discuss the broader implications of the findings on national security, technology dependence, and potential ethical concerns surrounding critical infrastructure.
