# We need to make sure you have a good _package_!

But first, where will you send?

# If you are applying for jobs in industry
1. Resume
2. Cover letter (sometimes)
3. Project samples (e.g., in a Github portfolio)

# If you are applying for jobs in government
Pretty much the same

1. Resume
2. Cover letter (sometimes)
3. Project samples (e.g., in a Github portfolio)

# If you are applying for positions in academia

1. <s>Resume</s> CV
2. Cover letter <s>(sometimes)</s> Always
3. Research statement
4. Project and research samples (e.g., in a Github portfolio, writing sample)

# In all cases

It's important that you pick a domain that interests you.

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
For example, my domain is in behavioral economics. I enjoy doing research about it, talking to others about it..

Same thing should apply to you e.g., if you want to go for finance.
:::

# Let's take a look at some job postings?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Look for qualifications required to get an idea of what is required from you.

You can browse `indeed.com`, `twitter`, or straight `google`

# Nice resume suggestions

<https://data36.com/data-science-cv-resume-cover-letter-github/#resume>

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Should be super clean and simple.
- You can use Word, Latex, Markdown.
  - I suggest Markdown or Latex, so you get some practice.
:::


# Cover letter
- Should explain why you are a good fit for the position.
Try to find 2-3 reasons why in particular you are a good candidate.

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- If you are thinking of graduate school: research statement is a similar idea, but from a research point of view, e.g., how your research interests align with the program you want to get into.
:::

# Github portfolio
- Your employer will want to see your skills and interests beforehand
- Projects you show in your personal Github portfolio works great to showcase your skills and interests

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - On another note, you should create your own personal website. Github enables you to do that free of charge (including free hosting) Check out my website: <https://ernbilen.github.io>
    - Hugo Apero template is amazing (mine is not Apero.. no time!)
    - Check out Alison Hill's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFu_upDL2o) on how to build one from scratch
:::

# Github portfolio
What kind of projects?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Needs to be "original".
  - Don't analyze titanic, iris, cars..
  - Ideally you would use novel data, e.g., scraped
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - You should show exploratory analyses + model(s)
    - Models, but not just for sake of modeling: should make sense with the purpose of your project
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - You can consider building a dashboard showcasing your data.
    - People (employers) love dashboards.
    - We will talk more about options for building a dashboard later in the semester.

- Short phone interview with someone from the HR
- Main interview(s): Usually multiple
    - 30-60 mins with a manager
    - Coding interview and/or case studies
      - This varies A LOT from company to company
      - You could be given a take-home question (a difficult one) to solve within 24 hours, or you could be asked to solve multiple questions via live coding, talk through your thinking
    - Potentially an interview with team members to see if you fit well into the team's culture (and the team fits yours!)

# Things you should prepare for
::: r-stack
::: incremental
- the coding interview
  - Ace The Data Science Interview (ADSI) book
- any questions you could be asked for about data analysis
  - Again ADSI, also browse [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) (with a large grain of salt) and [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful)
- why you applied
  - how you fit into the company/department's goals
  - you should do research about the company + department (and yourself!)

# Salary 
- You should always negotiate
  - You won't lose your offer if you negotiate
- Research about the average prices based on position, company size, **location**
  - \$120,000 salary in San Francisco is very different than $120,000 in Harrisburg
    - Make a guess? <https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/san-francisco-ca-vs-harrisburg-pa>
- You should aim for at least average salary for the position/experience level
  - It's good to know this number, in case the hiring manager asks you your salary expectations during interview
