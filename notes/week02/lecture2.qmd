# How to ask good research questions?

::: {.fragment .fade-up fragment-index="2"}
Skill that you learn over the years

-   But we can still work on it/improve it!
    -   It is perfectly ok to come up with terrible ideas early on.

(My third year paper! More on that later)

-   We will learn what makes an idea "good", what makes it "bad".
    -   Let's make sure we catch "bad" ideas early.

# There are two types of studies {auto-animate=true}

Experimental

$\hspace{1cm}$ is where you design an experiment (in a lab, or "field")

::: incremental
- _very_ expensive and intense to conduct.
- Examples: All STEM labs, Social sciences: psychology, experimental economics labs, field experiments: [One](https://web.stanford.edu/~pdupas/Tracking_rev.pdf), [Two](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/120/3/917/1841493), [Three](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/economics-study-finds-volume-discounts-dont-increase-profitability-video-games), A/B testing: [One](https://medium.com/@shabidzh/the-power-of-a-b-testing-the-solution-for-eas-video-game-simcity-5-82ceb418a76d) [Two](https://www.bindwise.com/blog/amazon-ab-testing-guide-examples-best-practices)
- Nice because you get clean variation.

Observational

# There are two types of studies {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing="ease-out"}

Experimental

Observational

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
$\hspace{1cm}$ is where you work with data that is observed from the "world"
:::

::: incremental
- This is 99\% of data science projects
- You can either collect the data yourself, use already existing datasets, or scrape unique data.
:::


# Where to start?
::: incremental
- First, need to find what interests you the most: i.e., your domain area.
  - Physics, economics, finance, biotech, ...

- Once you know your topic-area, think about potential projects that are
  1. Feasible to implement
      - Can you get the data in a reasonable time frame? Or if at all?
    
  2. That people would care about your findings, i.e., it improves the existing knowledge, creates a value added...
:::

# Where to start?

- Data could be a starting point.
  - If you use existing data, there is a good chance it was analyzed by >500 other researchers
  - If you scrape the data, it's easier to present new findings
    - Twitter, yelp... are scraped frequently, so it's difficult to be unique there, but the internet is vast!

- Does giving advertisements to instagram influencers help improve sales?

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- Does giving <u>advertisements to instagram influencers</u> help improve sales?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - Need to scrape this.
    - Is it legal? Good news: <https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court>
:::

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- Does giving advertisements to instagram influencers help improve <u>sales</u>?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - You need sales data from the companies giving ads.
  - Might be challenging for smaller companies
  - How to know? Google search!
:::

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- Does giving advertisements to instagram influencers help improve sales?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - You can try to simplify the setup by 
    - finding a company with revenue/market share data first
    - doing a search with company's name/hashtag on the platform, 
    - scrape and analyze the frequency of posts, \# of likes... match them with revenue data
    - fit a simple model checking correlation between "ad influence" and market revenue in each quarter
:::

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- Does giving advertisements to instagram influencers help improve sales?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
  - You can imagine doing this for multiple companies to compare \& improve the external validity of your project
    - External validity means your findings are applicable to other samples/populations.
    - E.g., you might find that giving \$X tax rebate for installing solar panels in a small town leads to residents installing more of these panels. Would this hold true for other places too? Big cities?
:::

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- You can come up with questions involving Twitter.
  - E.g., do people respond in certain way when a big news even happens.
  - Would involve text analysis, e.g., topic modeling, sentiment analysis
  - Caveat: Twitter API is not free, there are limitations. <https://developer.twitter.com/en/pricing/search-fullarchive>
  - Makes sense to start with a free account before purchasing a premium account.

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- Do restaurants that stay open for longer make more money per hour?
  - Difficulty: you don't have access to multiple restaurants' revenue data.
  - This study is not feasible.

# Good ideas, bad ideas?
- Do restaurants that stay open for longer <u>receive better reviews?</u>
  - This is doable through scraping Google Reviews or Yelp, but it is a significantly different (less impactful) question.

# Good ideas, bad ideas?

- What is the best James Bond movie?
  - Can't give a conclusive answer because it's subjective.
  
- You could change it to: "What is the James Bond movie with the highest box office sales?"
  - But, a quick Google search gives you the answer.
  
- You could try movie-level things: "Does event X happen more in James Bond movies in relative to other movies?"
  - Potentially very difficult to get this data.
  - But doable, e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/idvzzq/oc_how_the_number_of_words_spoken_by_a_character)
  - You need to make sure your audience would find your results interesting.
