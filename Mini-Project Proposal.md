#### Research Question

How does a country’s economic development affect the outcome of their world cup games?

#### Reason

I wanted to look into this topic since soccer is the most popular sport worldwide, and I thought it would be interesting to see if a country’s economy had any impact on their performance, rather than just look at player talent and skill. When you think about successful soccer countries, you think Germany, France, Spain, Argentina, and the Netherlands. While these are very developed countries, they are not your worldwide powerhouses. The US, China, Japan, Russia, and even India are incredibly developed yet do not have nearly as much success. We also see smaller, less developed countries like Croatia and Morrocco make deep runs in the playoffs. I think it would be interesting to see how economic development and possibly other economic indicators may benefit or hinder a country’s success. 

#### Data Sources

The match data comes from the Fifa World Cup, and economic development comes from The World Bank of Data.


#### Analysis
I plan on running different regression models to see how the varying variables affect the outcomes of a game. I would most likely have to create some dummy variables things like win or lose. I could also have a dummy variable for who has the higher GDP for instance within a match.
