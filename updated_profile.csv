Kelly Adams,Data Analyst @ Golden Hearts Games,"👋 Hey! I'm Kelly Adams, a data analyst at Golden Hearts Games. I also freelance as a content producer for Luke Barousse's YouTube Channel which creates videos focusing on data analytics tools.

I have a year of experience in data analysis, working closely with the product, user acquisition and marketing teams. At my job, I use tools like Google Looker, Google BigQuery, and Excel to extract, analyze, and visualize data, providing actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.

I transitioned careers from paralegal to data analyst in July 2023. After taking the Google Data Analytics Course in 2022, which I did on a whim, I decided that I wanted to be a data analyst. Being able to use technical skills to solve business problems drew me to the field. 

In college I studied to become a teacher. While that didn't happen I still value education and love teaching others. I post about what it's like being an early career data analyst, how I'm applying business knowledge to analytics and what I'm learning.

I am interested in intersections the of data science and social good, machine learning and public policy, as well as how to develop ethical AI. As a Muslim woman of color, and first-generation college student, I'm passionate about using data to make a meaningful impact in my community.

My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in data-related subjects, databases, and machine learning, from Data Structures, Analysis in Algorithms, Applied Machine Learning, Statistical Inference, to Introduction to Databases. My experience and coursework has deepened my understanding of analysis-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes by covering data modeling, normalization, and SQL for data manipulation. This foundation enabled me to develop efficient ETL workflows that prepare and transform data for analytical purposes, ensuring data integrity and optimizing performance for large-scale data collections, as well as preparing data for future machine learning pipelines. 

My technical skills encompass Python, R, Java/Javascript, Git, Linux, Excel, QGIS, and SQL, along with proficiency in machine learning frameworks like Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and more. 

I've gained practical experience at Break Through Tech, Coding it Forward, and Barnard Empirical Reasoning Center, contributing to real-world data projects utilizing machine learning, data analysis and data visualization tactics to tackle issues such as gender inequality in the workplace, automating health grant categorization, and gentrification and policing. 

My research experience includes co-authoring a paper presented at the Fifth Widening NLP workshop at the 2021 Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing Conference. This research involved scraping and analyzing Reddit posts using the Pushshift API to investigate changes in narratives of pregnancy before and after COVID-19 using natural language processing and machine learning methods.

I have always had an intense passion for computer science, and my quest for knowledge in this particular bandwagon has been deepened by an intense level of fascination which I used to have for anything that was closely or remotely connected with the realm of computers. I can still recollect the memories from my childhood where I spent playing myriads of computer games with the dedication of a staunch devotee. When my academic endeavor was being addressed emphatically, I thought I had found my calling on the very occasion and decided to make my move to complete my undergraduate course in Computer Science Engineering from AKTU University.

Working as an Associate Software Developer in Novelovox Softwares for over 2+ years, I have been exposed to the varied operations of the IT industry. I was initially assigned to a project in which my role was the implementation of design, development, validation, and support activities in line with architecture requirements. I also participated in knowledge management activities intending to ensure the highest level of services to customers. Later, I have had the opportunity to comprehend the customer requirements closely, convert the requirements to optimum design and render possible solutions in the Project Management field.
  
Having worked in Novelvox for 2+ years doing different responsibilities helped me to gain in-depth knowledge of different roles in Information technology. I wanted to combine the ability to provide business solutions and create new opportunities with technology and hence got motivated to pursue Masters in Information Technology and Management at the University of Texas at Dallas.

I learned various lessons and practiced using TCP/IP, the Penetration Test, firewalls, Nmap, etc. The classes show me what kind of work environment an IT employer works in a company.  

The previous jobs I have worked at are CCBOE Business Department, Augusta University Campus Recreation, and Walmart Neighborhood Market. I work at those jobs to practice my communication skills, customer service skills, teamwork skills, and adaptability skills.

Although my jobs are not IT types, I practice my cybersecurity skills and programming skills like HTML/CSS, Python, and C# to have a fundamental understanding. For example, I used python to create music in Sonic Pi, operate a DiddyBorg, and a small artificial intelligence program. Next, I used HTML/CSS to create a Website about why long-distance running events is great to watch in the Olympics. Lastly, I used C# to build a small rock, paper, scissor game.

Eric Caldwell,Job seeking Student of Software Development and Programming.,"I am a Veteran who is passionate about cyber security and continuing my learning of this field. I have much to learn still, and expect that I will have much to learn for a long long time. But I am loving what I am learning and look forward to starting my journey of learning on the Job! Till then I will continue my multi faceted education by utilizing the amazing teaching from TCM Academy. I am focusing my education on analyzing the current and future security threats and risk. I am currently in the top 7% on Try Hack Me, and practicing through Hack The Box! I am quite familiar with working with others towards a common security goal and see no reason why I cannot do the same in cyber security, as well as work with clients in discussing their safety. Additionally I have been studying python and have been utilizing tools provided to aid in the building of my own VMware Home lab. 

     Bit about me? Ok!
Before studying for Cyber security. I was a Big rig driver for film studios such as:(But not limited to) Walt Disney Studios. Warner Brothers. CBS. Sony Pictures. Lionsgate. And many many more. Working on such shows and films as: Seal Team 6, Myans, Etc. This all ended when a combination of spinal injuries that I accrued while in Service to our Country brought a rather abrupt end to my career. And I have had to move on.

     Prior to Driving for the studios. I was a Infantryman in the USMC reserves. After joining my unit, I was instantly made the Platoon radio operator. Placed in charge of millions of dollars of military coms gear, and in charge of the platoon (And eventually company) communications and encryption data used by that same communications gear.  

     Prior to this I was a construction supervisor. I worked my way up from pushing a broom throughout the jobsite to eventually running the entire jobsite. Throughout the process, I learned many of the skills utilized by trades such as: Steel and wood Framing. Layout.

My faculty advisor is available to help me when I am stuck, but this project is entirely self-guided. I'm responsible for crafting research questions and developing methodologies.

Annie Jiayi Yuan,MS in Business Analytics with a background in Business Economics seeking for a full time data analyst job in California,"I believe business is something personal beyond data, and combining technological analytics and human insights is always what I have wanted to work for post-graduation. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and big data, modern successful businesses have become more data-driven. But this does not mean that we should rely on technologies and computers for everything; they are not perfect even though we tend to think they are, and they may not be able to quantify some information and then fail to correctly model. But the combination of a professional sense of humanity and advanced technologies can much more effectively avoid this kind of situation since talented professionals will consider any information that may affect the market as a factor in additional to statistical models. This kind of professionals will be people who won’t be replaced by artificial intelligence in the future, and I strive to be one of them. 

After graduated from University of California, Irvine (UCI) with Bachelor’s degree in Business Economics, I pursed Master of Science in Business Analytics at W.P.

Shawn Poindexter,Machine Learning Engineer at Meta,"During my graduate research in astrophysics I uncovered the first evidence of a free-floating planet while mining a dataset of gravitational microlensing events. Later, I became fascinated with a formidable modeling problem needed to better understand blackhole accretion disks. This required building and efficiently scaling a distributed simulation that performs random lookups spanning a large supercomputer cluster. My Ph.D. advisor discouraged me from working on it fearing that it was too difficult. Despite the challenges and his doubts, I persisted and solved it. This experience taught me that the computer science and data science aspects of my research were more interesting to me than science of astrophysics.

Next, I re-entered the tech industry with a mixture of consulting for clients, leading an applied research team, and exploring a variety of side projects while at Gravity Jack. Machine learning became my focus. This included organizing a meet up to help inspire and educate others in ML and deep learning. Also, I built a deep learning regression model to estimate the pose of objects seen from a monocular camera which included the development of a variety of novel data collection and data generation techniques.

Sofia Acuna Callanaupa,"Computer Science Student | Seeking Full-Time Cybersecurity Job | Cybersecurity & Data Science Enthusiast | C++, C, Java, Python | 2024 Graduation","I'm a computer science student with a dedication to embracing the ever-evolving tech world with curiosity and creativity, as a hardworking Peruvian.

From a young age, I've been driven by a passion for continuous learning.  I wish to be a lifelong learner which is another reason why I majored in Computer Science.  I thrive on the excitement and fulfillment of acquiring knowledge and skills. Whether it's delving into the intricacies of programming languages like C++ and Python, delving into the world of cybersecurity, exploring best coding practices, or even mastering a new dance, I'm drawn to activities that stimulate my curiosity and foster personal growth.

My deep interest in cybersecurity is driven by a desire to safeguard the digital realm and protect individuals from the ever-present cyber threats. I firmly believe that it's crucial for more people to be aware of the dangers of cyber threats and how easily one can encounter malware.

Another area that continues to captivate me and I am working on is data science. While I'm still in the process of learning, it's incredible to see the vast array of libraries of data that impact people's lives every day. The ability to read, analyze, and convey vast amounts of information has the potential to enhance the lives of everyone.

Aside from the world of technology, cooking, and dancing are my other great passions. Dancing makes me feel incredibly free while cooking brings me peace. What's even more special is combining these two as a Latina; it makes my dishes even more delicious, and my dancing is even more joyful, especially when it is done with my family.

Let's motivate one another to keep exploring, learning, and growing in our personal journey.

Nicholas Telma,Villanova University Economics and Statistics Student ,"I am a motivated student at Villanova en route to earning a major in economics, a minor in statistics, and a minor in business (VSB). I am the president of the Entrepreneurship Society and a Math Peer Tutor. 

In May 2021, I launched The Wolf Pack Sports and Games Camp, a summer camp for elementary boys in Bethesda, MD. I handled product development, price differentiation, venue selection, parent communication, facility negotiations, equipment procurement, advertising creation, liability waiver drafting, counselor recruitment, and management. During the first summer, Wolf Pack had 52 sign-ups over 5 weeks. In the second summer, Wolf Pack had 128 sign-ups over 8 weeks. In the third summer, Wolf Pack had 268 sign-ups over 10 weeks. Building on lessons learned from each summer, I refined operations and camper/ family engagement. I have plans to expand the age group for the boys' section and introduce a girls' group for summer 2024!

In June 2023, I founded another business, OddJob Genie, a semi-automated odd job service that delivers an array of services to customers at one time. I developed a system through Google Scripts for jobs to be automatically scheduled after a customer submits a survey form. With the system, the customer automatically receives confirmation, reminders, and review forms (once the job is complete) and the worker automatically receives job instructions, job reminders, and earning reports. I handled product development, hiring/ onboarding, HR, customer communication, equipment procurement, advertising creation, liability waiver drafting, worker training, and management. A one-stop-shop service for all household chores demonstrated to be a sought-after solution. By the first 8 weeks of operation, OddJob Genie had 25 part-time employees who performed a total of 203 jobs. Through the lessons, feedback, and experience of this past summer, I am currently devising an improved operations plan. I am also building an app for the workers, managers, and operators that provides better capabilities and that also records and stores data more effectively!

I have extensive experience living and traveling overseas. As the son of a diplomat, I was exposed to a variety of the riches and cultures of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Thailand, Egypt, and more.

Coupled with this Master's degree, being a member of Beta Gamma Sigma (Business's top Honor Society), an Eagle Scout, and in the Order of the Arrow (Boy Scout's Honor Society), I know what commitment is and that there is nothing I cannot learn.

Furthering my career outside of internships and college, I plan to obtain the AWS Practitioner and Google Cloud Digital Leader certifications. I am open to networking and discussing opportunities that align with my interests.

Austin N. Murray ,Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Data Enthusiast,"First and foremost, I love writing code and I’m passionate about efficiency. I enjoy finding out-of-the-box solutions for new and challenging problems.

This is exactly what I've been doing in my 8 years of management experience with 3 years in the manufacturing environment. As an engineer, it has been rewarding to use my material science academic background to standardize processes to increase efficiency in forging and use my professional experience to help train both experienced and new employees. 

As an engineer and manager, you get to see the junction between business data: telling you how to improve the department and the practical engineering data: showing there is a need to change procedures or update equipment. Then you need to be able to interpret the data to present it to the people who need to hear it. 

Problem-solving skills are a must in the manufacturing world as nothing goes the way it is expected to. Working at both a national corporation and mom-and-pop shops, I have been able to solve problems with a variety of resources.

I recently finished a data science Bootcamp with Flatiron to enhance my coding skills, take my professional experiences to new levels, and dive deeper into the data. Now I can use my problem-solving skills and pair them with coding skills to help my team push projects that had become stagnant with the help of data.

Even when I’m not at work, I find myself writing code in my personal life and for those around me. For instance, this Spring I am developing a project to establish trends of an eCommerce store to optimize the inventory of my family’s small business. I plan to increase sales and reduce on-hand inventory.

I am confident that I can use my engineering experience and my experience analyzing data to help a company achieve its goals. In return, I’m looking to join a company that can provide challenges, cares about work-life balance, and helps me continue to learn and grow. A place where my work can help make an impact.

I can totally change the stereotypes you may have about the Millennial workforce. Well, not all of them, of course. I am a quick learner; I bring a fresh outlook to projects and ideas and sometimes can be hopefully optimistic. And, yes, I am energetic and adaptable as are many others of my generation. But I am also great at collaborating, communicating and building relationships across all the levels of an organization (at least others have said so). I understand the power of humbleness and hard work. For starters, I am a multilingual (English, Telugu and Hindi) and have lived, worked and studied in two countries (India & United States).

Apart from my academics, I  dance, paint or binge-watch on OTT. I am excited in meeting strangers and making new friends as I believe it gives a new perspective to what you see.

Srishti Sanjay Patil,MS in ITM @ University of Texas at Dallas | Actively seeking Full Jobs | Python | SQL | Product Management | Data Analyst | Project Management | Tableau | R  | Product | Power BI | AWS | Computer Engineer,"Hey there! 

I am Srishti Sanjay Patil a firm believer in the thought -
“Success is a clear reflection of the effort pride and passion with which a person lives! It’s in reaching for the stars that we raise ourselves to the height of our potential. “
My Undergraduate degree course has played a key role in developing my interest in ITM. It has given me a comprehensive exposure to courses like Database Management System, Data Warehousing, and Mining which helped me to learn the analysis of data and the administration of databases.
To enhance my skills and get hands-on experience in the field, I applied for an internship at Technocraft Institute, Nashik, where I worked as an intern in Web development. Got a hand on the technologies like HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, SQL queries, etc. Acquiring proficiency in these technologies, I developed my 3rd Year Mini Project - “Sports club Management System Website – ABS club” and the Final Year Project - “System for exploring Higher Education options” using Django. 
While working on a third-year project my mind was struck with a thought to digitalize my city so that it can meet the standard of the advanced tech world. Soon with the course work, I and my team commenced the start-up. Where we came up with a plan to serve the city with an E-commerce portal. Here, I got a clear perception of the subject areas like business process design, inventory management, logistics, data analysis, data handling, supply chain management, etc. As I was already interested in this field but personally working on it, I was compelled to acquire more knowledge about it. 
Endeavoring and exploring the path I am here in Texas graduating from UT Dallas to accomplish my next step towards a life worth living!

Juyi “Johnny” Yang,UCLA Data Science student seeking for Internships,"Greetings! I am a graduate student at UCLA majoring in Applied Statistics and Data Science. Having arrived in the United States at the age of 14, I have been greatly influenced by both Eastern and Western cultures. I spent two years in Kansas for high school and two years in the Bay Area for community college, where I was elected as the youngest and first Chinese student body president in college history at age 17.

After completing my undergraduate studies in Economics and working for a year, I decided to return to school and enhance my technical background. My post-graduation aspirations involve pursuing roles in Data science and Product Management.

Prior to UCLA, I served as the President of Cañada College, representing over 6,500 students. While maintaining a high standard of academic excellence, I managed a diverse team comprising 40% of international students and 60% of historically underrepresented students. Together, we organized more than 20 campus-wide events. I led my team in drafting the college's first-ever housing resolution to provide university housing for low-income students. This resolution is currently under review by the College Presidents and District Board of Trustees and, upon approval, will be passed on to the Redwood City Council.

At UCLA, I continued my commitment to student advocacy after being selected by the President to serve as his Chief of Staff. I successfully managed three impactful platforms, including a strategic partnership with residential leads to reduce laundry costs from $2.75 to $1.50 for the next 20 years, resulting in over $500,000 in annual savings for on-campus residents. I was also chosen as the only representative from China to be an inaugural member of the UCLA Chancellor's Leadership, Innovation, Networking, and Knowledge (LINK) program, which provided me with an opportunity to network with industry-leading professionals and social movement leaders from around the world, including billionaire philanthropist Meyers Luskin.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking (you can find me on Instagram @Luka_sauce), competing in E-sports (Top 0.5% in Global NBA2k Gaming), practicing traditional Chinese tea art, playing basketball, singing, and modeling.

While working as an analyst at Milliman, much of my time was spent wrangling data for productionized risk models and then running said models to generate trading recommendations for client portfolios. I learned about the robust automation, careful verification, and agile mindset necessary to maintain models that are relied upon for time-sensitive, expensive decisions. I loved the experience and eventually wanted to demystify the models I spent so much time maintaining and that our clients spent so much money trusting.

So after a hiatus to explore the country and spend time with family - I call it my ""pre-retirement"" - I rebooted my career by completing Springboard's Data Science Career Track and learning how to create models myself. I then used my new skills in machine learning to predict the likelihood that murder cases would be solved. I also created an NLP-based recommender for listings on craigslist.

Olivia Roth,Recent College Graduate Actively Seeking Employment | UX Research & Data Analysis,"Check out my website: https://16omroth.wixsite.com/olivia-roth

Hi! My name is Olivia and I am a recent college graduate currently seeking employment in UX Research or Data Analytics.

My most recent employment was at Ulta Beauty where I started as a Prestige Beauty Advisor but was promoted within the first month of work to Lead Cashier. My job there allowed me to develop as a leader teaching fellow coworkers the POS system as well as meeting daily sales/credit card goals. Although stressful at times, the work I did there was important for me to grow as a worker and to continue learning where my passions lie. I ended my employment there at the start of 2024 due to lack of management and unrealistic pay for the responsibilities my title required. I am more driven than ever to find my career job and am actively applying for those jobs.

If you are a recruiter or have any questions or want to connect, shoot me a message!

Who am I...

I am an Ohio native from a small town just outside of Columbus, OH that had big dreams of going out to California to pursue an education about the brain. Ever since I took a Psychology class in high school I became hooked on how the brain worked. Now that I have thus completed the courses, that dream is still alive and well. With a dedication to learning and utilizing my knowledge, my personal interest is to continue learning more about the impacts of technology/media on mental health. As someone who has had immediate contact with mental health both within my family and within myself, I know what it is like to feel lost on how to cope and how best to continue...living. With that said, my core values stem from that knowledge: respect, compassion, courage, and open-mindedness. Each value is central to understanding mental health and how it affects someone's life.

In terms of my career goals, I hope to endeavor within the tech world as I have always been interested in it. I have basic knowledge of Python from my studies as well as a core drive to learn. What I may lack in experience currently, I overwhelmingly compensate in work ethic and constant need to improve.",researcher,Summary: ...graduate currently seeking employment in UX Research or Data...,Ulta Beauty,Other,Licking Heights High School,High School Diploma,High School,Other,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,0,580,579,,0
